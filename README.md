# Chest-Logger

ChestLogger is a Spigot plugin for Minecraft servers that logs all interactions with chests. It records when chests are placed, opened, items are added or removed, and logs this data to a SQLite database. The plugin also provides commands to check chest logs, integrates with Discord for real-time notifications, and offers options to export logs for analysis.
